# 101 Dalmatian ID

After Roger and Anita decide to keep all the 101 dalmations, they move to a house in the countryside. They soon realize that they need a system to make sure that all the puppies are healthy and develop as they should, and they contact you to help them design a novel health supervision system for dalmatians.

The system will be installed in the kitchen door, and at every pass a camera takes a series of images of the passing puppy. The system monitors the health of each puppy, by estimating it's growth and it will also look for signs of injury. This will help Roger and Anita making sure that all the puppies are happy and healthy at any time.

A requirement of this system, is that it needs to learn the spot pattern of each puppy, and adapt as the puppies grow. There is no prior data as none of the puppies have names yet - there's such a caos that it will take Roger and Anita months to make all of them apart. We need to help them ;)
